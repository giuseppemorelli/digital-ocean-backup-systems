Automate your snapshot system and copy into multiple regions of Digital Ocean Datacenter

## The "Digital Ocean Backup Problem"

Droplets backups are made only once a week.  
You cannot choose frequencies and also is only in 1 region.  
You cannot choose to copy to other regions.

You cannot create a backup of volume with a schedule, just manually

Migrate from backup to snapshot can avoid those problems and let you "free to choose".

## Requirements

- nodejs >= 14
- npm >= 6
- Digital Ocean API Token ([here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/) you can find a guide to create an API Token)

## Installation

Download the code from releases [list](https://github.com/giuseppemorelli/digital-ocean-backup-systems/releases/)

or clone with git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giuseppemorelli/digital-ocean-backup-systems.git
```

Enter in project folder and run

```bash

npm install
cp .env.dit .env
```

## How to use

1) Edit `.env` as you like. Remember that `API_TOKEN` is a required data
2) Just run:

```bash
crontab -e

0 1 * * * /bin/bash /home/user/do-backup-system/bin/backup.sh
```

## Use with docker

Copy locally the env file sample

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giuseppemorelli/digital-ocean-backup-systems/main/.env.dist envfile
```

Edit `envfile` as you like. Remember that `API_TOKEN` is a required data
